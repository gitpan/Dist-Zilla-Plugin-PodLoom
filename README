CHANGES
    Here's what's new in version 4.10 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodLoom:
    (See the file "Changes" for the full revision history.)

	*** POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ***
	- PodLoom is now a FileFinderUser (defaulting to :InstallModules)

	  In most cases, this should not be an issue, but if you had
	  modules in the root directory, they won't be processed by
	  PodLoom anymore unless you override :InstallModules.
